# Ana the Anaconda

A graphical snake game coded in Python, in 
which the player can rotate the snake in any
direction. I coded the game engine myself 
using the PyGame library; for the game engine
itself I created a physics engine with the 
capability to simulate the motion of particles
in 2D using classical kinematics.

Currently in development.
